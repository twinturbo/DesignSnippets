These are parts of my circuits that I have gleaned from other resources and adapted to get working.

## Midi 
### Midi 3.3 V MCU input with tell tale 

The KiCad Schematic is for an input stage that takes MIDI data and presents it to a 3.3V MCU such as a Raspbery Pi Pico. It has 74HC14's to square up the signal and the benefit of a tell Tale LED.
